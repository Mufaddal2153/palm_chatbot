Let’s briefly review the\\nhistory\\nof respiratory protection.\\nRespiratory Protection – A History\\nThe use of respiratory protection can be traced as far as the Roman naturalist and philosopher, Pliny the Elder (23-79AD), who made use of loose animal bladder skins to filter dust from being inhaled while crushing cinnabar. Cinnabar is a toxic, mercuric sulfide mineral used at the time for pigmentation in decorations.\\nMany centuries later Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) recommended the use of wet cloths over the mouth and nose as a means of protection against toxic agents. During the 1700s, Bernadino Ramazzini (known as the father of occupational medicine) described the inadequacy of respiratory protection against the hazards of arsenic, gypsum, lime, tobacco, and silica.\\nIn 1919, the U.S. Bureau of Mines (USBM) initiated the first respirator certification program. Several months later, on January 15, 1920, this federal body certified the first respirator to protect miners from oxygen-deficient and toxic atmospheres.\\nFinally, the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 set standards to protect workers from safety and health hazards in their workplaces. This Act signified an important shift from advisable to mandatory respiratory protection for workers exposed to airborne hazards.\\nSource:\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\\nRespiratory Protection – Today\\nToday, the\\nNational Personal Protective Technology Laboratory (NPPTL)\\nat NIOSH is responsible for respirator certification. The primary function of this laboratory is to conduct research, testing, and post-market activities specific to personal protective equipment (including respiratory protection), thus ensuring a standard level of efficiency for all respirators used in US workplaces.\\nOne hundred years have passed since the first approved respirator. While the respirators may have changed in appearance over the years, their purpose remains the same – to protect workers from the adverse effects of airborne hazards.

      "3 Rewarding Safety Training Methods\n",
      "All employers are well-aware that their employees must receive the appropriate safety training in line with their job roles and responsibilities. While organizations such as the Occupational Safety and Health Association (\n",
      "OSHA\n",
      ") mandate a range of safety training across industries and occupations, these training requirements can differ from industry to industry and based on the risk levels to employees’ safety and health. Employees in construction, mining, hazardous waste, emergency response, hospitals, or factory operations are at greater risk as their exposure to hazards is higher than office-based occupations. Therefore, employers in such industries have a higher stake in ensuring employees are safeguarded than their counterparts in industries prone to lesser physical and health hazards such as banking, financial services, or even the stock exchange!\n",
      "Another set of individuals for whom safety training is of the utmost import is those involved in hazardous materials, chemicals, or hazardous waste transportation. These—full-time, part-time, or contract—employees of private carriers and shippers transporting hazardous cargo in commerce should receive training on reading hazard labels, placards, and hazard markings while being aware of the security requirements when transporting hazmat. The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) has put in place the Hazardous Materials Regulations (\n",
      "HMR\n",
      ") to guide on prevailing hazards of transporting hazardous substances and materials, together with guidance on training requirements.\n",

      "description\n",
      "Five Misconceptions About the Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) Regulation\n",
      "Myth 1:\n",
      "HAZWOPER training is only required for workers handling hazardous materials.\n",
      "While it is true that HAZWOPER training is often required for workers handling hazardous materials, it is also required for workers who may be exposed to hazardous substances or environments as a result of their work. This includes emergency responders, environmental cleanup workers, and workers at hazardous waste sites.\n",
      "Myth 2:\n",
      "HAZWOPER training is only needed for certain industries.\n",
      "HAZWOPER training is not limited to any specific industry. It is relevant for any worker who may be exposed to hazardous substances or environments as a result of their work. This includes workers in industries such as construction, manufacturing, healthcare, and oil and gas, as well as emergency responders and government employees.\n",
      "Myth 3:\n",
      "HAZWOPER training is a one-time requirement.\n",
      "HAZWOPER training is not a one-time requirement. It is important for workers to refresh their knowledge and skills on a regular basis, as the hazardous substances and environments they may encounter can change over time.\n",
      "Myth 4:\n",
      "HAZWOPER training is only required for workers in the United States.\n",
      "HAZWOPER training is not limited to the United States. Many countries have their own regulations and guidelines for the handling and disposal of hazardous materials, and workers in these countries may be required to complete similar training.\n",
      "Myth 5\n",
      ": HAZWOPER training is only for workers who directly handle hazardous materials.\n",
      "While it is important for workers who directly handle hazardous materials to have proper training, HAZWOPER training is also relevant for workers who may be indirectly exposed to hazardous substances or environments.

      "9 Workers Face a Near-Miss Situation as their Companies Fail to Implement Fire Safety Plans\n",
      "Two recycling companies in Sabine Pass, Texas face proposed penalties totaling $212,566 from OSHA after their failure to follow requisite safety standards resulted in nine workers encountering a serious near-miss situation.\n",
      "The nine workers had to be air-lifted after being trapped on a drilling platform almost 30 stories high as a fire broke out, as their employers failed to put fire safety plans into action. Welders from Carlos Arturo Guerrero LLC (CAG Professional Services) and employees of Houston-based PH Steel Inc. were cutting parts for metal scrap and making electrical repairs respectively on the main deck of the Pride Wisconsin drilling platform when the fire began. Soon thereafter, they found themselves unable to lower themselves to escape as the platform's generator wires burned down. As the situation worsened and first responders were incapable of reaching the workers, the U.S. Coast Guard carried out a rescue operation via helicopter.\n",
      "Investigations by OSHA into the February 25th, 2022, incident revealed that although Carlos Arturo Guerrero LLC had a written fire safety plan detailing evacuation procedures from tall jack-up platforms, they failed to use it. The company faces a sum of $140,055 in proposed penalties.\n",
      "The other company involved in the incident - PH Steel Inc., had no written fire safety plan. They stand to payout $72,511 in proposed penalties. For more details view the citation letters issued to\n",

      "“In an industry where workers face potentially serious and deadly hazards every day, employers must act quickly to safely evacuate workers and must ensure workers are trained on proper safety procedures,” said Mark Briggs, OSHA Area Director for Houston in regard to the situation (OSHA, 2022, August 23).\n",
      "This incident brings to light the importance of fostering an effective safety culture within organizations, especially those where workers are regularly exposed to hazardous situations. Despite safety plans and procedures being in place, a lack of an active safety culture can result in companies being unable to implement effective contingency measures in emergency situations, as demonstrated by the above incident.\n",
      "Safety is a team effort and should receive active participation from employees at every level within an organization. Workers also require regular training on safety and health hazards and related protection measures to ensure they are up-to-date on what needs to be done in case of an adverse situation and to ensure compliance with OSHA safety standards. Depending on your industry, workers could be exposed to several different types of hazards and will require training specific to each hazard type. Our blog,\n",

      "A Comprehensive Guide to HAZWOPER Training in Various Industries\n",
      "HAZWOPER (Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response) training is a program designed to ensure the safety and health of workers who handle hazardous materials in various industries. HAZWOPER training provides guidelines and procedures to minimize the risks associated with hazardous waste operations and emergency response thereby enhancing workplace safety.\n",
      "We provide a range of\n",
      "HAZWOPER training courses\n",
      "designed for employees involved in the handling of hazardous materials and the cleanup of hazardous waste sites.\n",
      "OSHA 40 Hour HAZWOPER Training\n",
      "HAZWOPER 24-Hour Training\n",
      "HAZWOPER 8-Hour Refresher Training\n",
      "HAZWOPER Supervisor Training\n",

      "8-Hour HAZWOPER RCRA TSD Operations Refresher Training\n",
      "Why is HAZWOPER Training Important for Worker Safety?\n",
      "The purpose of HAZWOPER training is to prevent and minimize the possibility of worker injury and illness resulting from potential exposures to hazardous waste and other hazardous substances. The HAZWOPER training covers a wide range of topics, including:\n",
      "Hazardous materials identification and classification,\n",
      "Hazardous waste handling and disposal,\n",
      "Site safety planning,\n",
      "Decontamination Procedures,\n",
      "Personal protective equipment (PPE), and\n",
      "Emergency response procedures.\n",
      "HAZWOPER training is an important part of protecting workers from the dangers to safety and health arising due to handling hazardous materials or hazardous waste. By ensuring that workers are properly trained, employers can help to prevent accidents and injuries, while increasing overall workplace safety standards.\n",
      "Benefits of HAZWOPER Training\n",
      "Increased awareness of hazardous materials and their potential hazards.\n",
      "Workers who have completed the OSHA 40 hour HAZWOPER training are better able to identify and assess hazardous materials, which can help them to avoid exposure.\n",
      "Improved understanding of PPE and how to use it properly.\n",
      "HAZWOPER training teaches workers about the different types of PPE and how to use it properly to protect themselves from exposure to hazmat.\n",
      "Improved site safety planning.\n",
      "HAZWOPER training teaches workers how to plan for and manage safe worksites when hazardous materials are present.\n",
      "Enhanced knowledge of emergency response procedures.\n",
      "HAZWOPER training teaches workers how to respond to emergencies involving hazardous materials, which can help to prevent accidents and injuries.\n",
      "Increased compliance with OSHA regulations.\n",
      "HAZWOPER training helps employers to ensure that they comply with OSHA regulations governing hazardous waste operations and emergency response.\n",
      "Frequency of HAZWOPER Training\n",
      "The level of training required depends on the worker's role and potential exposure to hazardous materials. Most workers must be given the 40 hour HAZWOPER training, but a shorter 24 hour HAZWOPER training program is also available for those workers only periodically exposed to hazardous materials or hazardous waste or those workers who have previous experience with hazardous materials.\n",
      "Click here\n",
      "to learn more about the difference between the HAZWOPER 40 and the 24 Hour training requirements as per OSHA requirements.\n",
      "Workers who have completed the initial HAZWOPER 40 or 24 hour training must receive annual refresher training as per OSHA requirements. The refresher training must be at least eight hours long and must cover the same topics as the initial training.\n",
      "It is important to note that some states follow OSHA State-specific regulations which may be different or more stringent than OSHA HAZWOPER federal regulations. Therefore, it is recommended to consult local authorities such as the OSHA office to ensure compliance with the applicable HAZWOPER training requirements in your area.\n",
      "Which Industries Require HAZWOPER Training?\n",
      "According to OSHA, workers in a variety of industries require HAZWOPER training, including:\n",
      "Construction Industry\n",
      "Workers involved in the cleanup of hazardous waste sites, such as Superfund sites or brownfield sites, must have HAZWOPER training. This includes workers who are involved in demolition, excavation, or other activities that could expose them to hazardous materials.\n",
      "Manufacturing or Industrial Operations\n",
      "Workers who use or handle hazardous materials in manufacturing facilities must have HAZWOPER training. Workers who are involved in the production process of toxic chemicals and other hazmat also require HAZWOPER 40 training. This includes workers in industries such as chemical manufacturing, petroleum refining, and plastics production.\n",
      "Treatment, Storage, and Disposal (TSD) Facilities\n",
      "Workers involved in the treatment, storage, or disposal of hazardous waste at TSDFs must have HAZWOPER training. This includes workers in facilities that handle hazardous waste from a variety of sources, such as industrial facilities, hospitals, and businesses.\n",
      "Oil and Gas Industry\n",
      "Workers employed in oil refineries, drilling operations, and pipelines are exposed to various hazardous substances and can potentially encounter emergency situations. HAZWOPER 40 training is mandatory for workers involved in such work operations.\n",
      "Transportation and Shipping\n",
      "Workers who transport hazardous materials by air, land, or water must have HAZWOPER training. This includes drivers, loaders, and other workers who are involved in the transportation of hazardous materials.  Companies involved include chemical distributors, trucking companies, and shipping companies. Such workers require HAZWOPER training to comply with regulations and respond effectively to emergencies.\n",
      "In addition, employees of such companies or those workers involved in such work also require the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Hazardous Materials Regulations (DOT HMR) training to ensure compliance with DOT hazmat regulations.\n",
      "Click here\n",
      "for a list of DOT HMR training courses.\n",
      "Laboratories\n",
      "Workers employed by research and testing laboratories that handle hazardous chemicals and materials require HAZWOPER training to ensure the safety of laboratory personnel.\n",
      "Engineering\n",
      "Engineers who design, construct, or operate facilities that handle hazardous materials or hazardous waste must have HAZWOPER training. This includes engineers who work in the design and construction of chemical plants, refineries, and other industrial facilities.\n",
      "Environmental Services\n",
      "Workers who provide environmental services, such as environmental consulting or remediation, or work in waste management or recycling operations must have HAZWOPER training. This includes workers who are involved in the assessment, cleanup, or disposal of hazardous waste. If such workers are frequently exposed to hazmat, then they require the HAZWOPER 40 hour training course.\n",
      "Emergency Response\n",
      "Firefighters, hazmat teams, and emergency responders require specialized HAZWOPER training to safely handle and mitigate incidents involving hazardous materials. Such workers specifically require the HAZWOPER Q series training as per the OSHA HAZWOPER standards.\n",
      "In addition to these industries, OSHA may also require HAZWOPER 40 or 24 hour training for workers in other industries that handle hazardous materials or hazardous waste. Workers who are unsure whether they need HAZWOPER training should consult with their employer or a qualified safety professional. They may also contact their local OSHA office for more information.\n",
      "In Conclusion\n",
      "OSHA HAZWOPER training is an important tool for protecting workers from the dangers arising due to exposure to hazardous materials and hazardous waste across industries and work tasks. By identifying the need for HAZWOPER training, and ensuring that workers are properly trained, employers can help to prevent accidents and injuries, increase organizational reputation, reduce costs related to worker compensation and regulatory fines, and thereby create a safer workplace for everyone.\n",

      "A Safe Workplace For Young Workers\n",
      "With the holiday season fast approaching, OSHA has issued a reminder to young workers of their right to a safe workplace, and adequate training for the job in question. Just as you click to confirm your purchase, the wheels on the other end are set in high gear to deliver your order in time for the holidays. This spike in sales of merchandise is accompanied by an inevitable increase in the number of young workers who become a part of the workforce.\n",
      "Young workers are those who are new to the workforce, even up to age 24. Young workers can be a valuable asset to the workforce. However, it may be their first job or the first time they are operating equipment. Child labor laws restrict the types of jobs, hours worked and equipment used by youth under age 18. Young workers get injured or sick on the job for many reasons, including:\n",
      "Unsafe equipment;\n",
      "Inadequate safety training;\n",
      "Inadequate supervision;\n",
      "Dangerous work that is illegal or inappropriate for youth under 18;\n",
      "Pressure to work faster; and\n",
      "Stressful conditions.\n",
      "Workplace hazards associated with specific jobs are another major cause of injuries and illnesses. To this end, employers must work to reduce or minimize hazards in the workplace and train employees on how to work safely on the job.\n",
      "OSHA\n",
      "has issued the following set of guidelines specifying employer responsibilities for young workers:\n",
      "Understand and comply with the relevant federal and state child labor laws.\n",
      "Provide training about workplace hazards and required safety gear, and ensure that young workers are competent in safe work practices.\n",
      "Implement a mentoring or buddy system for new young workers. Have an adult or experienced young worker answer questions and help the new young worker learn the ropes of a new job.\n",
      "Encourage young workers to ask questions about tasks or procedures that are unclear or not understood. Tell them whom to ask.\n",
      "Remember that young workers are not just \"little adults.\" You must be mindful of the unique aspects of communicating with young workers.\n",
      "Ensure that equipment operated by young workers is both legal and safe for them to use. Employers should label equipment that young workers are not allowed to operate.\n",
      "Tell young workers what to do if they get hurt on the job.\n",

       "'title\\nWhat is Toxicology?\\ndescription\\nWhat is Toxicology?\\nMost people will relate the word\\ntoxicology\\nto popular medical dramas and crime shows on television. Dr. Richard Weber’s case of cobalt poisoning in the season 16 finale of\\nGrey’s Anatomy\\nis a good example of medical toxicology. While shows such as\\nCSI, NCIS,\\nand\\nBones\\ndepend on\\nforensic toxicology\\nto solve their crime-scene cases. Some of us may have also heard the word used in science laboratories while in high school. But what exactly does\\ntoxicology\\nmean? The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines\\ntoxicology\\nas “a science that deals with poisons and their effect and with the problems involved (such as clinical, industrial, or legal problems)”. The National Institute of Environmental Sciences (\\nNIEHS\\n) provides a more comprehensive understanding of toxicology:\\nToxicology is a field of science that helps us understand the harmful effects that chemicals, substances, or situations, can have on people, animals, and the environment. Some refer to toxicology as the “Science of Safety” because as a field it has evolved from a science focused on studying poisons and adverse effects of chemical exposures, to a science devoted to studying safety. (n.d.)\\nThe above explanation ties up very well with the impact of chemical hazards and toxins in the workplace. As industries continue to use more and more chemicals, pesticides, insecticides, and other toxic substances in farming, new product developments, carrying out day-to-day business operations, and undertaking specialized processes, workers are exposed to higher concentrations of hazardous substances that can adversely affect their health and well-being. Hence, the “Science of Safety” (NIEHS, n.d.) being attributed to the study of toxicology has become extremely relevant in today’s global context.\\nOccupational Diseases in the Workplace\\nToxicology is intrinsically related to\\noccupational diseases\\n. Many workers develop occupational diseases due to long-term exposure to chemicals, radioactive materials, and other harmful substances.\\nCenturies ago, coal miners worked in highly dangerous conditions. They expected to catch some diseases (many which had no cure and more that they were unable to name) due to their exposure to poisonous gases and other hazardous substances while they earned a living. They were also well-aware that they could be fatally wounded or even succumb to their injuries due to a fall, a cave-in, the collapse of an underground mine shaft, or any other unknown and yet undiscovered hazard(s). These were accepted risks by personnel working in coal mines of yesteryear. While evolution and worldwide development resulted in better working conditions and the addition of safety aspects in the workplace, these early workers no doubt lacked the many safety and health guidelines enjoyed by today’s employees. After all, until 1970 workers in the United States did not have the benefit of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\\nOSHA\\n) or the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (\\nNIOSH\\n). While, today, the global working population benefit from the many dedicated institutions across countries and industries as well as the many international organizations that work to ensure their health and safety while at work.\\nAs such, today’s workers are better safeguarded from toxic substances in the workplace. However, progress has also brought about new occupational diseases and hazards, and exposed workers to new types of toxic gases, chemicals, and other substances that have been discovered or man-made over the years. These newly emerging toxins continue to plague workers causing new health risks and health effects even as state-of-the-art techniques are used to analyze the effect of these chemicals on human health. Concurrently, regulatory agencies continue to develop innovative safety protocols that must be ingrained as part of workplace health and safety plans.\\nTypes of Occupational Diseases\\nWhile occupational health and safety has become an important and often mandatory consideration by employers, the increasing use of chemicals and toxic substances has resulted in increased health hazards and risks to workers. Thus, toxicology in the workplace continues to be an important factor in safeguarding employees from occupational diseases. Here are a few occupational disease groups that have been identified to exist in different industries and professions, many of which can occur due to the use or handling of toxic chemicals as part of job tasks.\\nRespiratory diseases\\nContact dermatitis\\nMusculoskeletal disorders\\nMental disorders\\nCardiovascular diseases\\nOccupational cancers\\nKey Considerations of Toxicology\\nHow people react to chemical toxin exposure and develop occupational diseases varies. Human biology while the same still differs from person to person, males to females, and adults to children. Genetics, age, and pre-existing ailments also impact how chemical toxicity is absorbed by the human body. Hence, how one worker reacts to a poisonous substance may be very different from how a second or third worker is affected. Thus, toxicologists must consider these DNA and biological differences when developing occupational exposure data and setting parameters for toxicity data.\\nWhen employers embark on workplace risk-assessment to identify possible toxin contamination in work areas, exposure of workers to toxic substances and develop methodologies to safeguard workers from adverse impacts from pollutants, the following factors must be considered.\\nThe length or period of exposure to the chemical toxin;\\nThe dose (i.e. amount) of substance exposure;\\nPre-existing medical conditions;\\nThe metabolism of the individual;\\nGender, age, weight, etc.;\\nAllergies and drug reactions;\\nAn individual’s habits (smoking, medication use, alcohol consumption nutritional intake, etc.);\\nThe method of exposure – inhalation, ingestion, injection, and absorption; and\\nType of exposure – direct or indirect exposure, acute exposure, chronic exposure, or accidental exposure.\\nOSHA and Toxicology\\nOSHA has identified the importance of toxicology in the workplace and enforces safety standards to be followed by employers. These requirements range from the number of chemicals and other hazardous substances that workers can be exposed to; toxic substance safe limits at a worksite; processes and practices that should be implemented; protective measures and equipment that must be used; the need for periodic toxicological testing and medical surveillance for workers; and the recording of workplace injuries, occupational diseases, and accidents due to the use of hazardous substances.\\nAccordingly, OSHA has developed\\nOccupational Exposure Limits (OELs)\\nfor different air-borne toxins related to a range of occupations, industries, chemicals, and toxic substances. While stipulating Permissible Exposure Limits (PELs) which are based on 8-hour time-weighted averages (TWA), OSHA also specifies Ceiling and Peak limits which must be compulsorily adhered to by employers. While many of the details are available in the applicable sections of the\\nGeneral Industry\\n,\\nConstruction\\n,\\nShipyard Employment\\n, Marine Terminals, and Longshoring regulatory standards, the most up-to-date information is available as an\\nAnnotated Table\\n.\\nOther organizations have also established OELs that must be followed by employers in different industries where workers are exposed to various hazardous substances. For instance, NIOSH has developed Recommended Exposure Limits (RELs) for workers exposed to hydrogen sulfide and other chemicals and airborne toxins. For additional details refer to the\\nNIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards\\n.\\nHow Can Workers Learn About Toxicology in the Workplace?\\nThe increased exposure to chemicals and other hazardous substances in activities such as mining, hazardous waste operations, pharmaceutical research, oil and refining, manufacturing operations, chemical production, waste treatments, etc., has resulted in a heightened focus on educating workers employed in these industries to identify, understand, and know how to protect against exposure to toxic substances and emergencies. OSHA has also identified workers involved in hazardous waste operations as being at greater risk of toxicity exposure. As such, OSHA provides extensive guidance through its\\nHazard Communication Standard (HCS)\\non the information that must be shared with and available to employees who work with or may be exposed to toxic substances.\\nOSHA’s requirement to train workers before they start work at construction sites and other worksites exposed to hazardous substances ensures that employees will receive relevant training on toxicology. The subject of toxicology is covered in several of our training courses such as the\\nHAZWOPER 40 Hour\\n, the\\nHAZWOPER 24 Hour\\n, and the\\nHAZWOPER 8 Hour Refresher\\n.\\xa0Aspects of toxicology related to different hazardous substances such as\\nOSHA Asbestos Awareness Training\\nand\\nOSHA Hydrogen Sulfide Awareness Training\\nare included in\\nsubject-specific training courses\\ndeveloped by us.\\nReferences\\nEvans, M.

      "  Context: title What is Toxicology? description What is Toxicology? Most people will relate the word toxicology to popular medical dramas and crime shows on television. Dr. Richard Weber’s case of cobalt poisoning in the season 16 finale of Grey’s Anatomy is a good example of medical toxicology. While shows such as CSI, NCIS, and Bones depend on forensic toxicology to solve their crime-scene cases. Some of us may have also heard the word used in science laboratories while in high school. But what exactly does toxicology mean? The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines toxicology as “a science that deals with poisons and their effect and with the problems involved (such as clinical, industrial, or legal problems)”. The National Institute of Environmental Sciences ( NIEHS ) provides a more comprehensive understanding of toxicology: Toxicology is a field of science that helps us understand the harmful effects that chemicals, substances, or situations, can have on people, animals, and the environment. Some refer to toxicology as the “Science of Safety” because as a field it has evolved from a science focused on studying poisons and adverse effects of chemical exposures, to a science devoted to studying safety. (n.d.) The above explanation ties up very well with the impact of chemical hazards and toxins in the workplace. As industries continue to use more and more chemicals, pesticides, insecticides, and other toxic substances in farming, new product developments, carrying out day-to-day business operations, and undertaking specialized processes, workers are exposed to higher concentrations of hazardous substances that can adversely affect their health and well-being. Hence, the “Science of Safety” (NIEHS, n.d.) being attributed to the study of toxicology has become extremely relevant in today’s global context. Occupational Diseases in the Workplace Toxicology is intrinsically related to occupational diseases . Many workers develop occupational diseases due to long-term exposure to chemicals, radioactive materials, and other harmful substances. Centuries ago, coal miners worked in highly dangerous conditions. They expected to catch some diseases (many which had no cure and more that they were unable to name) due to their exposure to poisonous gases and other hazardous substances while they earned a living. They were also well-aware that they could be fatally wounded or even succumb to their injuries due to a fall, a cave-in, the collapse of an underground mine shaft, or any other unknown and yet undiscovered hazard(s). These were accepted risks by personnel working in coal mines of yesteryear. While evolution and worldwide development resulted in better working conditions and the addition of safety aspects in the workplace, these early workers no doubt lacked the many safety and health guidelines enjoyed by today’s employees. After all, until 1970 workers in the United States did not have the benefit of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration ( OSHA ) or the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ). While, today, the global working population benefit from the many dedicated institutions across countries and industries as well as the many international organizations that work to ensure their health and safety while at work. As such, today’s workers are better safeguarded from toxic substances in the workplace. However, progress has also brought about new occupational diseases and hazards, and exposed workers to new types of toxic gases, chemicals, and other substances that have been discovered or man-made over the years. These newly emerging toxins continue to plague workers causing new health risks and health effects even as state-of-the-art techniques are used to analyze the effect of these chemicals on human health. Concurrently, regulatory agencies continue to develop innovative safety protocols that must be ingrained as part of workplace health and safety plans. Types of Occupational Diseases While occupational health and safety has become an important and often mandatory consideration by employers, the increasing use of chemicals and toxic substances has resulted in increased health hazards and risks to workers. Thus, toxicology in the workplace continues to be an important factor in safeguarding employees from occupational diseases. Here are a few occupational disease groups that have been identified to exist in different industries and professions, many of which can occur due to the use or handling of toxic chemicals as part of job tasks. Respiratory diseases Contact dermatitis Musculoskeletal disorders Mental disorders Cardiovascular diseases Occupational cancers Key Considerations of Toxicology How people react to chemical toxin exposure and develop occupational diseases varies. Human biology while the same still differs from person to person, males to females, and adults to children. Genetics, age, and pre-existing ailments also impact how chemical toxicity is absorbed by the human body. Hence, how one worker reacts to a poisonous substance may be very different from how a second or third worker is affected. Thus, toxicologists must consider these DNA and biological differences when developing occupational exposure data and setting parameters for toxicity data. When employers embark on workplace risk-assessment to identify possible toxin contamination in work areas, exposure of workers to toxic substances and develop methodologies to safeguard workers from adverse impacts from pollutants, the following factors must be considered. The length or period of exposure to the chemical toxin; The dose (i.e. amount) of substance exposure; Pre-existing medical conditions; The metabolism of the individual; Gender, age, weight, etc.; Allergies and drug reactions; An individual’s habits (smoking, medication use, alcohol consumption nutritional intake, etc.); The method of exposure – inhalation, ingestion, injection, and absorption; and Type of exposure – direct or indirect exposure, acute exposure, chronic exposure, or accidental exposure. OSHA and Toxicology OSHA has identified the importance of toxicology in the workplace and enforces safety standards to be followed by employers. These requirements range from the number of chemicals and other hazardous substances that workers can be exposed to; toxic substance safe limits at a worksite; processes and practices that should be implemented; protective measures and equipment that must be used; the need for periodic toxicological testing and medical surveillance for workers; and the recording of workplace injuries, occupational diseases, and accidents due to the use of hazardous substances. Accordingly, OSHA has developed Occupational Exposure Limits (OELs) for different air-borne toxins related to a range of occupations, industries, chemicals, and toxic substances. While stipulating Permissible Exposure Limits (PELs) which are based on 8-hour time-weighted averages (TWA), OSHA also specifies Ceiling and Peak limits which must be compulsorily adhered to by employers. While many of the details are available in the applicable sections of the General Industry , Construction , Shipyard Employment , Marine Terminals, and Longshoring regulatory standards, the most up-to-date information is available as an Annotated Table . Other organizations have also established OELs that must be followed by employers in different industries where workers are exposed to various hazardous substances. For instance, NIOSH has developed Recommended Exposure Limits (RELs) for workers exposed to hydrogen sulfide and other chemicals and airborne toxins. For additional details refer to the NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards . How Can Workers Learn About Toxicology in the Workplace? The increased exposure to chemicals and other hazardous substances in activities such as mining, hazardous waste operations, pharmaceutical research, oil and refining, manufacturing operations, chemical production, waste treatments, etc., has resulted in a heightened focus on educating workers employed in these industries to identify, understand, and know how to protect against exposure to toxic substances and emergencies. OSHA has also identified workers involved in hazardous waste operations as being at greater risk of toxicity exposure.

OSHA’s requirement to train workers before they start work at construction sites and other worksites exposed to hazardous substances ensures that employees will receive relevant training on toxicology. The subject of toxicology is covered in several of our training courses such as the HAZWOPER 40 Hour , the HAZWOPER 24 Hour , and the HAZWOPER 8 Hour Refresher . Aspects of toxicology related to different hazardous substances such as OSHA Asbestos Awareness Training and OSHA Hydrogen Sulfide Awareness Training are included in subject-specific training courses developed by us.
